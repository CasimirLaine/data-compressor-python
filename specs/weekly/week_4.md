This week I spent most of the time refining the Lempel-Ziv decoder and implementing Huffman encoding and decoding.
I learned how the Huffman compression algorithm works.
Initially had some issues encoding the Huffman tree in bits.
The most difficult part this week was correctly decoding the data from Huffman tree.
Especially reconstructing the huffman tree from bits.
Next week I will do some fine-tuning for the algorithms and write the requested documents.
Also will be implementing rest of the tests for the codebase.
Will also spend some time peer-reviewing other projects.
