This week spent most of the time improving the huffman decoding process.
Noticed a few bugs regarding that.
I also added enough tests to make sure both algorithms perform as expected.
I improved the code quality by isolating format conversions to a separate module.

In addition, I started to write documentation, specifically the manual and testing documentation.

The most difficult part of this week was to make the Huffman algorithm correct.

There is still a small issue when dealing with files so next week will be spent on fixing those and improving Lempel-Ziv.
Will also start writing or finish the remaining documentation requested.

Finally, I will add the performance results regarding the algorithms after I have further optimized them.
