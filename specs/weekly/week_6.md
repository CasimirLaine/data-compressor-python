This week I wrote documentation for the project including manual, and testing documentation.
Additionally, I also wrote file-related unit tests for the encoding algorithms.

I resolved and issue with the Huffman decoding when reading data from files.
The issue was related to line breaks.

The peer reviews I received were really helpful in gaining insight from outside on my project design and code quality.
I also got valuable information from reviewing other people's implementations.

Next week I'll include the performance tests results and graphs of the algorithms.
I will also prepare for the forthcoming demo.
